## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to group Spotify songs into clusters based on their various characteristics using K-Means clustering. An algorithm such as this can be used to create a song recommendation system for Spotify users by recommending songs within the same cluster. 

## The Dataset
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle at: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs/data) 
The dataset contains the following columns:
- 'TRACK_ID': Song ID
- 'TRACK_NAME': Song Name
'TRACK_ARTIST': Song Artist
'TRACK_POPULARITY': Song Popularity With a Rating of 0-100 Where a Higher Rating is Better
'TRACK_ALBUM_ID': Album ID
'TRACK_ALBUM_NAME': Album Name
'TRACK_ALBUM_RELEASE_DATE': Album Release Date dd/mm/yyyy
'PLAYLIST_NAME': Name of Spotify Playlist
